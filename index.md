# Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio showcasing my growth and expertise developed throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University.

## About This Portfolio

This ePortfolio demonstrates my mastery of key computer science concepts through enhanced artifacts in three critical areas:

- **Software Design and Engineering**
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** 
- **Databases**

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has shaped my professional identity as a software engineer. Over two years, I developed comprehensive full stack web development skills, learned algorithmic efficiency principles, and cultivated a security conscious mindset. This ePortfolio demonstrates my growth across software design, algorithms and data structures, and database management, showcasing readiness to contribute professionally in web development with future goals in security engineering.

The program built my technical foundation while clarifying career direction. Beyond the artifacts in this portfolio, I independently developed the Classic Messenger App, a full stack real time messaging platform. This project utilized Node.js, Express, WebSockets, Redis pub/sub for scalability, Multer for file handling, and PostgreSQL on the backend, with a React frontend using HTML, CSS, and WebSocket integration for real time communication. Building this production application taught me to architect complex systems, manage state across distributed components, and deploy to Heroku with continuous integration practices.

  
Coursework in CS 405 (Secure Coding), CS 360 (Mobile Architecture), and CS 320 (Software Testing) strengthened my understanding of the software development lifecycle. The capstone process itself proved invaluable for developing professional communication skills. Creating code review videos taught me to explain technical decisions to diverse audiences, while writing enhancement narratives forced me to articulate design trade offs essential in professional environments.

Collaboration and Communication

Group projects and peer reviews taught me to build collaborative environments where diverse perspectives improve outcomes. The Classic Messenger App required careful API design between frontend and backend that involved the consideration and collaboration of my peers, ensuring clear goals and milestones as well as comprehensive communication throughout the building process of these accomplishments. 

Professional communication extends beyond documentation to code clarity. The enhancements in this portfolio demonstrate this through modular architecture and meaningful naming conventions. When implementing role based access control, I structured middleware and controllers to make security logic transparent and maintainable. Deploying applications to production taught me to balance technical requirements with user experience and operational constraints, enabling effective communication with both technical and non technical stakeholders.

Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Engineering

My understanding evolved from abstract concepts to practical performance tools. The contact management enhancement demonstrates this through replacing O(n) linear search with O(1) hash map lookups, requiring careful management of data consistency and space time trade offs. In the Classic Messenger App, I implemented Redis for caching frequently accessed data and managing WebSocket pub/sub across server instances, directly applying data structure knowledge to solve scalability challenges.

The software engineering enhancement showcased adaptability across languages and paradigms. Porting the contact application from Java to JavaScript required architectural reimagining using modern ES6 features, webpack bundling, and GitHub Pages deployment. This mirrors professional development where engineers adapt to diverse technology stacks and tooling ecosystems.

Security and Database Management

Developing a security oriented mindset transformed my approach to software design. The database enhancement required adversarial thinking about privilege escalation and unauthorized access, guiding implementation of middleware authentication and session validation. In the Classic Messenger App, I implemented JWT based authentication, secure password hashing with bcrypt, and input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Security operates at every layer so I implemented client side validation for user experience and server side validation for actual security. When adding user banning functionality, I recognized that database flags alone were insufficient because active sessions would persist, requiring session invalidation logic. Database work integrated security with performance through strategic indexing on frequently queried columns using CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to avoid downtime, and automated maintenance through cron jobs for ban expiration handling.

The artifacts demonstrate breadth across computer science fundamentals while maintaining focus on web development and security. The contact management application shows software engineering through architectural transformation and algorithmic optimization through data structure improvements. The Classic Messenger App enhancements represent production quality full stack development integrating security and database management throughout the system. Together with the independently developed full messenger application, these projects showcase my capabilities as a full stack developer with strong fundamentals in algorithms, databases, and security.

This program equipped me with technical skills, professional practices, and security consciousness necessary for software engineering success. I bring not only coding ability but also communication skills, collaborative mindset, and commitment to continuous learning. The artifacts that follow provide detailed analysis of enhancement processes and course outcomes achieved, offering concrete evidence of my readiness to deliver secure, scalable software solutions in professional environments.
